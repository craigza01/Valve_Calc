This application is used for sizing control valves. It is uses the formulas and constants contained within the ISA-75.01.01-2007 (IEC 60534-2-1 Mod) standard.I have only implimented the calculations for Incompressible fluids, but have included all the constants for the gasses and vapors as provided within the standard.

The calculator is for metric calculations, so only Kv is calculated at this stage. To convert -> Cv = Kv * 1.15. I am not going to implement Cv calculations as I never work with imperial units.

I will more likely than not update the calculator for compressible fluids at a later stage.
